        <h1>What is The Science Lab?</h1>
        <p class="px-2">
            The Science Lab is a free open source project made by The Science Lab Group at Ali Ebn Abi Taleb language school.
            It primarily focuses on increasing the information of the students about the latest new curriculum
            and testing them with a lot of exercises on all units.
            All this while giving them a fun and joyful experience similar to what they get while playing games.
            It combines the fun and happiness of playing with the benifit of studying and memorizing in order to 
            give the students a healthy useful alternative to wasting time and playing video games.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Science Lab contains exercises on all grades, each grade contains a lot of games made to help practice and memorize
            the lessons better. They are also an excellent way to test the amount of information and understanding the student has 
            in all the units of his grade. The awesome collection of different games kills boredom and gives the student many alternatives
            to choose from. At the end of each game, a results page appears with the score of the user, what this
            score means, and detailed information about what needs to be done in order to make the level of the student higher and increase their score.
